/Users/urmilbhansali/Coding Projects/WorkoutTracker/app/src/main/java/com/workouttracker/AnalyticsFragment.kt:407: Warning: Implicitly using the default locale is a common source of bugs: Use String.format(Locale, ...) instead [DefaultLocale]
                    String.format("%.1f", value)
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DefaultLocale":
   Calling String#toLowerCase() or #toUpperCase() without specifying an
   explicit locale is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that
   those methods will use the current locale on the user's device, and even
   though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app,
   it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the
   uppercase replacement for i is not I.

   If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to
   convert an enum name, call String#toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT) instead. If you
   really want to use the current locale, call
   String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault()) instead.

/Users/urmilbhansali/Coding Projects/WorkoutTracker/app/build.gradle:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with,
   various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application
   continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the
   targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the
   UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NewerVersionAvailable":
   This detector checks with a central repository to see if there are newer
   versions available for the dependencies used by this project. This is
   similar to the GradleDependency check, which checks for newer versions
   available in the Android SDK tools and libraries, but this works with any
   MavenCentral dependency, and connects to the library every time, which
   makes it more flexible but also much slower.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NotifyDataSetChanged":
   The RecyclerView adapter's onNotifyDataSetChanged method does not specify
   what about the data set has changed, forcing any observers to assume that
   all existing items and structure may no longer be valid. `LayoutManager`s
   will be forced to fully rebind and relayout all visible views.

    android:background="?attr/selectableItemBackground"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Overdraw":
   If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a
   custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme
   background will be painted first, only to have your custom background
   completely cover it; this is called "overdraw".

   NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated
   with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently
   doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can
   incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then
   wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

   If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should
   consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using
   that theme instead of a root element background.

   Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you
   want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better
   performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that
   resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

            ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
   ,

   Available options:

   **skip-libraries** (default is true):
   Whether the unused resource check should skip reporting unused resources in libraries.

   Many libraries will declare resources that are part of the library surface; other modules depending on the library will also reference the resources. To avoid reporting all these resources as unused (in the context of a library), the unused resource check normally skips reporting unused resources in libraries. Instead, run the unused resource check on the consuming app module (along with `checkDependencies=true`).

   However, there are cases where you want to check that all the resources declared in a library are used; in that case, you can disable the skip option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UnusedResources">
           <option name="skip-libraries" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

/Users/urmilbhansali/Coding Projects/WorkoutTracker/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

/Users/urmilbhansali/Coding Projects/WorkoutTracker/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher_round.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive roundIcon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.

   Explanation for issues of type "Autofill":
   Specify an autofillHints attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher
   or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app
   can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the
   meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing
   usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc.

   The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined
   values like 'username' for a username or 'creditCardNumber' for a credit
   card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the
   AUTOFILL_HINT_ constants in the View reference at
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.

   You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an
   importantForAutofill attribute on that view or a parent view. See
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportant
   ForAutofill(int).

   Explanation for issues of type "UseKtx":
   The Android KTX libraries decorates the Android platform SDK as well as
   various libraries with more convenient extension functions available from
   Kotlin, allowing you to use default parameters, named parameters, and
   more.

   Available options:

   **remove-defaults** (default is true):
   Whether to skip arguments that match the defaults provided by the extension.

   Extensions often provide default values for some of the parameters. For example:
   ```kotlin
   fun Path.readLines(charset: Charset = Charsets.UTF_8): List<String> { return Files.readAllLines(this, charset) }
   ```
   This lint check will by default automatically omit parameters that match the default, so if your code was calling

   ```kotlin
   Files.readAllLines(file, Charset.UTF_8)
   ```
   lint would replace this with
   ```kotlin
   file.readLines()
   ```
   rather than

   ```kotlin
   file.readLines(Charset.UTF_8
   ```
   You can turn this behavior off using this option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UseKtx">
           <option name="remove-defaults" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

   **require-present** (default is true):
   Whether to only offer extensions already available.

   This option lets you only have lint suggest extension replacements if those extensions are already available on the class path (in other words, you're already depending on the library containing the extension method.)

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UseKtx">
           <option name="require-present" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

   Explanation for issues of type "SetTextI18n":
   When calling TextView#setText
   * Never call Number#toString() to format numbers; it will not handle
   fraction separators and locale-specific digits properly. Consider using
   String#format with proper format specifications (%d or %f) instead.
   * Do not pass a string literal (e.g. "Hello") to display text. Hardcoded
   text can not be properly translated to other languages. Consider using
   Android resource strings instead.
   * Do not build messages by concatenating text chunks. Such messages can not
   be properly translated.

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
